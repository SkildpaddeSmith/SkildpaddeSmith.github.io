      <h2>Quick Note</h2>
      <p class="standard">for this Website I used GitHub because it is free! other websites can be used and will probably follow the same process.</p>

      <h2>Log in to GitHub</h2>
      <p class="standard">If you have a GitHub account log in, if not you need to create an account</p>

      <h2>Create a new repository</h2>
      <p class="standard">On the home page on the left hand side a repository nav bar and there should be a green button that say new at the top. MAKE SURE THE REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC. If it is not public you will have to restart the process.</p>

      <h2>Install Github Desktop</h2>
      <p class="standard">I installed Github Desktop, but I believe that you can also asscess it online if you do not wish to download it.</p>

      <h2> Install Atom or Your Text Editor of Choice</h2>
      <p class="standard">This is hwere we will be writing our code so choose a Text editor that you are comfortable with.</p>

      <h2>Open your repository</h2>
      <p class="standard">In Github Desktop you should now be able to open the repository you made earlyer and then it should let you open it in your Text Editor.</p>

      <h2>Adding files (index.html, style.css and style.js)</h2>
      <p class="standard">Once you have your repository open in your Text Editor you are going to need to add three files index.html (The main beef of the website), style.css (the stlye and look of your website) and style.js (extra buttons to make your website look more professional). The style.js is an optional file to add it is not nessesary to make the website.</p>

      <h2>Configure your repository</h2>
      <p class="standard">This is the step that allows you and others to see your website. If you did not make your repository public this will not work! In GitHub you will need to go to the setting tab located on the right of the nav bar. under Code and Automation category on the left bar, click the Pages tab. Under the section titled branch you will need to choose the branch you want your website to hosted from.</p>

      <h2>You're Finished!</h2>
      <p class="standard">Your website should now be asscessable! All you have to do now is add the code for your website in the files made earlier.</p>
